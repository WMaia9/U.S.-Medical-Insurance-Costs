The project will be done in 3 parts.
The first part will be analyzed the data provided. Know what the variables are and what each one represents.
Make some histograms and graphs of the data provided.
In the second part we will talk about analyzing the data from the linear regression. A simple case study will be
done for one variable and then for multiple variables.
The third part will focus on visualizing the adjusted models. We will look at the residual plots and the error
band.
